With the rapid evolution of the Internet, malware has emerged as a significant cyber threat in contemporary times. Malware encompasses any software designed to carry out malicious activities such as information theft, espionage, and more. According to Kaspersky Labs (2017), malware is defined as "a type of computer program crafted to infiltrate a legitimate user's system and cause harm through various means."

Despite the expanding variety of malware, traditional antivirus scanners are struggling to provide adequate protection, leaving millions of systems vulnerable to attacks. In 2015, Kaspersky Labs reported that 6,563,145 different hosts were targeted, with 4,000,000 unique malware objects detected. Juniper Research (2016) predicts a global increase in the cost of data breaches to $2.1 trillion by 2019.

Furthermore, there has been a decline in the level of expertise required for malware development, partly due to the widespread availability of hacking tools on the Internet. The accessibility of anti-detection techniques and the ability to purchase malware on the black market have democratized the ability to engage in cyber attacks. Recent studies indicate a rising trend of attacks being carried out by script-kiddies or automated processes (Aliyev, 2010).

The conventional approach to malware detection through signature-based methods is becoming increasingly ineffective, as modern malware exhibits polymorphic characteristics to evade detection. Additionally, malware often employs mechanisms to autonomously update itself, making it harder for antivirus software to keep up with new variants.

Machine learning has emerged as a promising solution for antivirus software, as it enables the detection of new threats without relying solely on signatures. Unlike traditional fingerprinting methods, which compare files against a database of known malware, machine learning can discern between benign and malicious files by learning patterns, thereby detecting malware even if it has not been encountered before.
